# Mode scaling of a Combinatorial Metamaterial
This is the code repository for simulating the scaling of the number of zero modes accompanying the paper 'Machine Learning of Combinatorial Rules in Mechanical Metamaterials' published in 'XXX'. This code includes code to randomly generate unit cells and calculate the number of zero modes for tilings of this unit cell. Additionally, it includes the code to check if a unit cell obeys the strip mode rules as described in the paper.
